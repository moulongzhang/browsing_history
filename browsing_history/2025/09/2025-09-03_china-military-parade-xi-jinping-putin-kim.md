## Summary

China hosted a massive military parade in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on September 3, 2025, commemorating the end of World War II. The event featured over 10,000 troops and showcased hundreds of advanced weapons including air-defense lasers, stealth fighter jets, drones, and undersea robots. The parade demonstrated China's significant investment in modern warfare capabilities and its growing military power under Xi Jinping's push to modernize the world's largest standing army.

The most striking aspect of the event was the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un flanking Xi Jinping - marking the first time the three authoritarian leaders have been photographed publicly together. This powerful image symbolized their shared vision for an alternative world order that challenges US and Western dominance. The trio's unity was further emphasized through Putin's praise of North Korean troops fighting for Russia in Ukraine, and Kim's pledge to support Russia "as brothers."

While the parade showcased China's military might, it also occurred amid ongoing global conflicts, with Russia launching over 500 drones and 24 missiles against Ukraine during the same period Putin attended the Beijing event. The display prompted responses from US President Trump, who accused the three leaders of "conspiring against America," though Russian officials denied any conspiracy.

China's military parade unveils newest weapons as Xi welcomes leaders challenging Western order. Presiding over a military parade in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the end of World War II, leader Xi Jinping said China's rise is "unstoppable." Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un flanked Xi at the start as the trio stood together publicly for the first time — a defiant challenge to the US-led world order.

The parade showcased a mix of conventional weaponry and advanced technologies, including air-defense lasers, stealth fighter jets, drones and undersea robots, highlighting China's significant investment in modern warfare capabilities. Rows of soldiers goose-stepped in perfect unison — long a hallmark of authoritarian regimes' militaries. One of the most striking images of the day was Xi walking toward the Tiananmen rostrum, flanked on either side by Putin and Kim, with the other world leaders following behind.

It was a clear statement of unity between the strongman leaders, who share a vision for an alternative world order that can counter the US and its Western partners. After the parade, Putin and Kim held closed-door talks for more than two hours, and Putin invited Kim to visit Russia. Before those talks, Putin thanked North Korean troops for fighting for Moscow against Ukraine, and Kim said his country would support Russia "as brothers."

Kim also brought two members of his family to Beijing, photos show – his sister Kim Yo Jong, believed to be one of his closest confidantes and advisors, and a young girl believed to be his daughter Kim Ju Ae, who has sparked speculation about being his potential successor. US President Donald Trump wrote a sarcastic social media post as the parade got underway, saying: "May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America."
