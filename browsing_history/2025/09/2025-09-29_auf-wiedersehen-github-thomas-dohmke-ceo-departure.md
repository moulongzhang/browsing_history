## Summary

Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub, announced his departure from the company to pursue new entrepreneurial ventures. In his farewell blog post titled "Auf Wiedersehen, GitHub ♥️," Dohmke reflects on his journey from moving to the United States after Microsoft acquired his startup over a decade ago, to leading GitHub through its transformation into the AI-powered platform it is today.

During his tenure as CEO, Dohmke oversaw GitHub's evolution into a platform serving over 150 million developers and hosting more than 1 billion repositories. Under his leadership, GitHub launched and scaled GitHub Copilot from a simple autocompletion tool to a comprehensive AI coding assistant with over 20 million users. He emphasizes that GitHub Copilot has introduced "the greatest change to software development since the advent of the personal computer."

Dohmke will remain with GitHub through the end of 2025 to facilitate the transition. GitHub will continue its mission as part of Microsoft's CoreAI organization, with more leadership details to be shared soon. He concludes by expressing his vision for a future with "one billion developers enabled by billions of AI agents" and credits GitHub as the starting point for this technological revolution.

tl;dr: I am stepping down as GitHub CEO to build my next adventure. GitHub is thriving and has a bright future ahead. The following is the internal post I sent to GitHub employees (Hubbers) this morning announcing my departure.

Over a decade ago, my family and I made the leap to move from Germany to the United States after the sale of my startup to Microsoft. In the years since, I've had the privilege of working with many exceptional human beings, including Hubbers, Microsofties, customers, partners, our GitHub Stars, open-source maintainers, and developers around the world who've helped us shape GitHub.

Still, after all this time, my startup roots have begun tugging on me and I've decided to leave GitHub to become a founder again. GitHub and its leadership team will continue its mission as part of Microsoft's CoreAI organization, with more details shared soon.

With more than 1B repos and forks, and over 150 million developers, GitHub has never been stronger than it is today. We have seen more open-source projects with more contributions every year. AI projects have doubled in the last year alone. And our presence in companies of any size is unmatched in the market. The GitHub platform has continued to lead with incredible momentum...
