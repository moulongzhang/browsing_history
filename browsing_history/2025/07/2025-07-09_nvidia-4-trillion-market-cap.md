## Summary

Nvidia achieved a historic milestone on July 9, 2025, when its stock jumped and briefly pushed the company's market capitalization past $4 trillion for the first time in intraday trading. This makes Nvidia the first company ever to achieve this market value during trading, surpassing tech giants Microsoft and Apple, both of which had previously hit the $3 trillion mark. However, the stock ended the day up only 1.8%, giving the company a market cap of $3.97 trillion.

The California-based company, founded in 1993, has experienced meteoric growth driven by the generative AI boom. Nvidia first passed the $2 trillion mark in February 2024 and surpassed $3 trillion in June of the same year. The company has positioned itself as the decisive leader in creating graphics processing units (GPUs) that power large language models, benefiting heavily from growing demand for AI hardware since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.

Despite geopolitical tensions and ongoing chip export restrictions that have hampered sales to China, Nvidia's stock has continued to rally. The company's shares have risen more than fifteenfold over the last five years, with gains of more than 15% over the past month and 22% since the start of 2025. Microsoft, one of Nvidia's biggest and most important customers, also benefits from this AI hardware boom.

Nvidia stock rose on Wednesday lifting the company's market cap briefly past $4 trillion for the first time as investors scooped up shares of the tech giant that's building the bulk of the hardware for the generative artificial intelligence boom.

However, Nvidia stock ended finishing the day only up 1.8%, giving the company a market cap of $3.97 trillion.

Nvidia is the world's most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft and Apple, both of which hit the $3 trillion mark before Nvidia. Microsoft is also one of Nvidia's biggest and most important customers. The chipmaker is the first company to ever achieve this market value during trading.

The California-based company, which was founded in 1993, first passed the $2 trillion mark in February 2024, and surpassed $3 trillion in June.

Nvidia has profited heavily from the growing demand for AI hardware and chips since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. The company has positioned itself as the decisive leader in creating the graphics processing units that power large language models.

The surge in demand has boosted shares in the chipmaking behemoth more than fifteenfold over the last five years. Nvidia's shares are up more than 15% over the last month and 22% since the start of the year.

The recent rally in Nvidia has come despite geopolitical tensions and ongoing chip curbs that have hampered sales to China. Nvidia has also recovered from fears sparked by China's DeepSeek model earlier this year that future AI wouldn't need so many chips.
