## Summary

According to reports from The Guardian, Donald Trump is reportedly backing a plan that would require Ukraine to cede unoccupied territory in the Donbas region to Russia as part of a peace deal to end the ongoing war. This information emerged from leaked details of Trump's post-summit call with European leaders on August 16, 2025. The proposed deal would involve Ukraine giving up the Donbas region (comprising Donetsk and Luhansk regions) in exchange for Russia halting further advances and freezing the frontline in southern Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

The report indicates that Putin demanded Ukraine withdraw from Donbas as a condition for ending the war, offering Trump a freeze along the remaining frontline. This represents a significant breach with Ukraine and European allies who oppose such territorial concessions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to meet with Trump in Washington on Monday, while European leaders have expressed that territorial decisions must remain with Ukraine and that international borders should not be changed by force.

Trump has expressed support for moving straight to a peace deal rather than implementing a ceasefire first, arguing that ceasefires "often times do not hold up." The proposal has raised concerns among Ukrainian and European leaders, who fear that bypassing a preliminary ceasefire gives Moscow an upper hand in negotiations.

Donald Trump will back a plan to cede unoccupied Ukrainian territory to Russia to secure an end to the war between the two countries, it was reported on Saturday, after details of his post-summit call with European leaders leaked out.

Trump told European leaders that he believed a peace deal could be negotiated if the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, agreed to give up the Donbas region, which Russian invaders have not been able to seize in over three years of fighting, the New York Times reported, citing to two senior European officials.

Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks in Alaska told the Guardian that Putin demanded Ukraine withdraw from Donbas, which is made up of the Donestk and Luhansk regions, as a condition for ending the war, but offered Trump a freeze along the remaining frontline.

Although Luhansk is almost entirely under Russian control, Ukraine still holds key parts of Donetsk, including the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk and heavily fortified positions whose defence has cost tens of thousands of lives.

Putin told Trump that in exchange for Donetsk and Luhansk, he would halt further advances and freeze the frontline in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where Russian forces occupy significant areas.

Trump's support for ceding Ukraine's Donbas region, which is rich in mineral resources, including coal and iron ore, to Russia comes as he voiced support for moving straight to a peace deal and not via a ceasefire, which, Trump said in a social media post on Saturday, "often times do not hold up."

US support for ceding the Donbas to Russia represents a breach with Ukraine and European allies that oppose such a deal. As part of a deal, the US is ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said on Saturday.
