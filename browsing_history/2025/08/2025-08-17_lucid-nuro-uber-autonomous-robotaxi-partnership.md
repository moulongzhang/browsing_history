## Summary

Lucid Group, Nuro, and Uber have announced a strategic partnership to launch a next-generation autonomous robotaxi program exclusively for the Uber platform. The collaboration combines Lucid's Gravity electric vehicle platform, Nuro's Level 4 autonomous driving technology (Nuro Driver™), and Uber's global ride-hailing network. Uber plans to deploy 20,000 or more Lucid vehicles equipped with the Nuro Driver over six years, with the first launch expected in a major US city next year.

The partnership represents a significant investment opportunity, with Uber planning multi-hundred-million dollar investments in both Nuro and Lucid. The robotaxi service will leverage the Lucid Gravity's 450-mile EPA estimated range, advanced vehicle architecture, and redundant electrical systems, making it ideal for high-utilization autonomous operations. The vehicles will be owned and operated by Uber or its third-party fleet partners and made available exclusively through the Uber platform.

The first Lucid-Nuro robotaxi prototype is already operating autonomously at Nuro's Las Vegas proving grounds. This partnership aims to demonstrate the commercial viability of autonomous vehicles at scale, combining proven self-driving technology with real-world deployment capabilities across Uber's global network of 70 countries and 34 million daily trips.

The first Lucid-Nuro robotaxi prototype is already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro's Las Vegas proving grounds.

As part of a deepening relationship with each partner, Uber plans to make multi-hundred-million dollar investments in both Nuro and Lucid.

"Autonomous vehicles have enormous potential to transform our cities for the better," said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber.
